## Why PawFeed?

**PawFeed** is on a mission to make feedback collection cool again. We believe that gathering feedback should be as effortless and enjoyable as a game of fetch with your dog (woof!). That‚Äôs why we created an open-source, easy-to-use feedback collection widget for React applications. With PawFeed, you can start collecting feedback in seconds, without the hassle.

But we‚Äôre not stopping there. We understand the importance of filtering out the noise and focusing on what really matters: constructive feedback. To help you do that, we‚Äôre launching a beta program featuring advanced machine learning capabilities that will:

1. **Filter out negative and non-constructive feedback** ‚Äì Cut through the noise and focus on insights that drive improvement.
2. **Prioritize constructive feedback** ‚Äì Ensure the most valuable feedback is front and center.
3. **Auto-summarize feedback** ‚Äì Get a clear overview of user sentiment and key takeaways.
4. **Integrate with tools like GitHub, Jira, Linear, and more** ‚Äì Seamlessly convert feedback into actionable tasks and issues.

And the best part? You remain in full control of your data throughout the process!

Join us in making feedback collection a positive, productive experience. Let‚Äôs fetch the insights that will help your app thrive!
